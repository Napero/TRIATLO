# TRIATLO
Inspired by my game [TATLO](https://github.com/Napero/TATLO)

Very simple JavaScript game.
The objective is to turn all the cells the same color.
You can play it on [the itch.io page!](https://napero.itch.io/triatlo)
The color combos are taken from Splatoon 3 splatfest ink colors.

Click to flip a cell and its neighbours. The clicked tile is flipped into the previous color in the cycle and the noughbours are flipped into the following one. 
Press R to generate a new scramble.
Press I to input new width and height values. Default is 7 by 5.
